## Key Insights

### What Makes PicoTTS Efficient

1. **Compact representation** - Mel-cepstral coefficients compress spectrum 5:1
2. **Fast algorithms** - Table-free FFT, fast exp approximation, loop unrolling
3. **Decision trees** - O(log N) lookup, small memory footprint, fast traversal
4. **Streaming design** - Incremental processing, low latency, constant memory
5. **Fixed models** - No training needed at runtime, deterministic performance

### What Limits Quality

1. **16 kHz sampling** - Frequency range limited to 8 kHz (telephone quality)
2. **Formant synthesis** - Less natural than unit selection or neural TTS
3. **Simple prosody** - Rule-based, lacks nuanced emotion and emphasis
4. **Fixed acoustic models** - Cannot adapt to new speakers or accents

### Optimization Philosophy

**For ESP32:**
- Leverage hardware acceleration (FPU, I2S DMA, dual-core)
- Use platform-specific libraries (ESP-DSP for FFT)
- Optimize memory layout (XIP, SPIRAM, heap placement)
- Convert critical paths to fixed-point arithmetic
- Add smart caching for frequent operations

**Balance:** Quality vs. Speed vs. Memory
- Current PicoTTS balances all three well
- ESP32 optimizations can improve speed and memory without sacrificing quality
- Advanced features (Phase 4) can improve quality with acceptable performance trade-off
